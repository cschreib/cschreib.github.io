  <p>I am an astronomer with a general interest in galaxy evolution. More specifically, my area of expertise is the statistical study of star formation in galaxies and its evolution from the birth of the Universe to the present day. I obtained my PhD in 2015 at CEA Saclay (France) and am currently employed as a post-doctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl">Leiden University</a> (The Netherlands).</p>

  <p>As an observer, my goal is to use the largest telescopes in the world to detect and characterize galaxies at various epochs of the Universe, and confront these observations with current models of galaxy evolution. My work is based on deep images of the sky obtained with the Very Large Telescope (VLT), the Atacama Large Milimeter Array (ALMA), and the Hubble, Spitzer and Herschel space telescopes. These images allow us to detect the emission of stars in the near-infrared, and cold interstellar dust in the sub-millimeter.</p>

  <p>Aside from science, I am interested in C++ programming in general, and promote the use of this language (in its modern version) in the astrophysics community to improve the robustness and speed of our codes. I am also an amateur photographer and guitarist.</p>
