## The dominant mode of star formation in galaxies

# Context

In the 90s, deep optical images from the Hubble space telescope allowed us to observe the redshifted ultraviolet light of distant galaxies, a direct probe of their star formation activity. From these images, astronomers first deduced that, 9 Gyr ago, galaxies were forming stars an order of magnitude faster than today ([Madau et al. 1998](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998ApJ...498..106M)). The main uncertainty in this result comes from the absorption of the galaxies' light by interstellar dust. In the present-day universe, only 30% of the light is absorbed by dust in a typical spiral galaxy ([Saunders et al. 1990](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990MNRAS.242..318S)). The absorbed energy is re-emitted in the far-infrared (FIR), which is a domain where observations are more difficult, and typically much less sensitive. Only a minority of galaxies are strongly obscured by dust, and these also happen to be experiencing intense star formation bursts caused by a violent encounter with another galaxy ([Sanders et al. 1996](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996ARA%26A..34..749S)). The impact of dust was therefore deemed marginal.

Only later did it become clear that this was a mistake. Deeper observations of the FIR sky were produced by ISO...
