This is the first blog entry of this website.

I am impressed at how quick and easy it was to setup the entire thing; ```github``` folks sure know the meaning of "user friendly"! And the result is quite neat, even with the default theme. I may tune that later if ever I find the strength to delve into this CSS madness, but that will do for now.

I am not sure how frequently I will use this blog in the future, but that is also a nice feature to have. I will most likely use this to advertise published papers and codes, and perhaps also share some thoughts and tricks about C++ in general. Let's see how this goes!

In the mean time, you're welcome to browse through the categories at the top-right corner of the screen. These include a description of some of the public codes I released, as well as detailed information about my research interests and contributions.
